The pattern helps to reduce memory usage by sharing data among multiple objects.

Intrinsic data: shared among objects and remain same once defined one value.
Extrinsic data: change based on client input and differs from one object to another.


- From Object, remove all the Extrinsic data and keep only Intrinsic data (this object is called Flyweight Object)
- Extrinsic data can be passed in the parameter to the Flyweight class.
- Caching can be used from the Flyweight object and used whenever required.
